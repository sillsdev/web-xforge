// This script searches for projects that are in the sync state. It is intended to be used for finding projects that
// are stuck in a perpetual state of syncing. Keep in mind that when things go wrong the project's state may not fully
// reflect whether a Hangfire job is currently in the queue for this project, so checking the Hangfire dashboard at the
// same time may be useful.
