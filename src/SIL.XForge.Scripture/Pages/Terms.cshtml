                <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
                <p>The actual SIL International Language Software Terms of Use is available <a href="https://software.sil.org/language-software-terms-of-use/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. It is copied below for your convenience.</p>

                <p><strong>Summer Institute of Linguistics, Inc.</strong> (<em>dba SIL International</em>) produces and publishes apps in many languages of the world. The SIL International Language Software Terms of Use is to help you understand what, if any, data we collect as a result of you using our software and services, and what we do with that data.</p>

                <h2>Using our software</h2>
                <p>Using SIL Software does not give you any legal interest or intellectual property rights to the software nor to SIL-owned content, or to the User-created content you can access through the software.</p>
                <p>SIL software or services may allow you to view and download content that is not SIL’s. Such User-created content is the sole responsibility of the individual or organization that created it. SIL does not review all content created by users of our software and services and is not responsible for the quality, accuracy, selection, or appropriateness of any user-created content. SIL may remove or refuse to display content we determine to be illegal, offensive, inaccurate, or which violates SIL’s ethical standards.</p>

                <h2>Privacy and Copyright Protection</h2>
                <p>SIL does not send unsolicited or “spam” email and does not sell, rent, or trade its email lists to third parties. If you supply us with your postal or email address, you will receive the information for which you provided us your address. Details about the data that we collect and how we treat that data can be found in our <a href="~/privacy/">privacy policy</a>.</p>
                <p>SIL investigates all reports of alleged copyright infringement and will terminate accounts of any repeat infringer, following the process set out in the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf">U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a>.</p>
                <p>SIL will attempt to provide information and assistance to help content developers to manage their intellectual property online.

                <h2>Your Content</h2>
                <p>Some of our services allow you to share data. Sharing data using our services does not alter the intellectual property rights that you or others hold for that data.</p>
                <p>If you are the owner of the intellectual property rights to the data you are permitted to upload the data using our software and services. If you are not the owner of the intellectual property rights of the data you are not permitted to upload the data unless you have the owner’s permission to do so; in that case you are responsible for ensuring that the owners of the intellectual property rights of the data understand and agree to these terms and conditions prior to uploading the data.</p>
                <p>By uploading data to our service you give SIL a non-exclusive worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from linguistic analysis, translations, or other changes we make), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of improving our support for language(s), promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues as long as you have content hosted on the service.</p>
                <p>SIL invites your feedback and suggestions about our software and services but the implementation of any changes is at the sole discretion of SIL, and SIL will not necessarily notify you of any changes which may be made as a result of ideas you submit.</p>

                <h2>Your accounts</h2>
                <p>You will need one or more accounts in order to upload data. The treatment of your personally identifiable information associated with any accounts is described in our <a href="~/privacy/">Language Software Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>About open source software</strong><br> Most of the software we produce is offered under an <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MIT open source license</a>.
