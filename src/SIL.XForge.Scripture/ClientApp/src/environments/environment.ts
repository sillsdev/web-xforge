// The file contents for the current environment will overwrite these during build.
// The build system defaults to the dev environment which uses `environment.ts`, but if you do
// `ng build --prod` then `environment.prod.ts` will be used instead. And if you do
// `ng build --configuration=pwaTest` then `environment.pwa-test.ts` will be used instead.
// The list of which env maps to which file can be found in `angular.json`.
// The environment object should not be generated dynamically. This seems to cause problems with production builds.
