# Build for running on another computer.
# This is turning into a bit of a kludge, in order for the product filename to contain the date,
# the contents to be contained within a top-level folder, and not leave old intermediate production
# files laying around. But it works.
#
# Usage: ./build-production
#
# To run product on another computer:
# Set ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT to Development on a workstation, Staging for QA, or omit it for Live.
# Set PROJECT_IDS to "<project_1_ID> <project_2_ID> ... <project_N_ID>" to limit projects
# Set RUN_MODE to "true" to perform the migration, or omit to do a dry run
# Extract program:
#   tar xf backout-commits-*.tar.xz
# Run:
#   ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development SF_APP_DIR="/path/to/sf/app" backout-commits-*/BackoutCommits
