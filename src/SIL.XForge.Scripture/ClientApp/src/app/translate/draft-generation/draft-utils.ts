/**
 * Takes a SFProjectProfile and returns the training and drafting sources for the project as three arrays.
 *
 * This considers properties such as alternateTrainingSourceEnabled and alternateTrainingSource and makes sure to only
 * include a source if it's enabled and not null. It also considers whether the project source is implicitly the
 * training and/or drafting source.
 *
 * This method is also intended to be act as an abstraction layer to allow changing the data model in the future without
 * needing to change all the places that use this method.
 *
 * Currently this method provides guarantees via the type system that there will be at most 2 training sources, exactly
 * 1 training target, and at most 1 drafting source. Consumers of this method that cannot accept an arbitrary length for
 * each of these arrays are encouraged to write there code in such a way that it will noticeably break (preferably at
 * build time) if these guarantees are changed, to make it easier to find code that relies on the current limit on the
 * number of sources in each category.
 * @param project The project to get the sources for
 * @returns An object with three arrays: trainingSources, trainingTargets, and draftingSources
