This commit has a completely incorrect description. The heading
"Simplify usage of confirmation dialog" is correct. The issue numbers
are wrong, and the description underneath (that goes with those issue
numbers) is also wrong. Somehow when merging it I mixed it up with
another PR. At this point it's already on QA and it seems like it
wouldn't be easy  to go back and edit the description.
