# This is turning into a bit of a kludge, in order for the product filename to contain the date,
# the contents to be contained within a top-level folder, and not leave old intermediate production
# files laying around. But it works.
#
# Usage: ./build-production
#
# To run product on another computer (with ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT set to Development on a workstation, Staging for QA,
# or omitted for Live):
# tar xf ptda-sync-all-*.tar.xz
# ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development SF_APP_DIR="/path/to/sf/app" ptda-sync-all-*/PtdaSyncAll |& tee /tmp/ptda.log
